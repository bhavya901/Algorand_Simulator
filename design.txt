main function creates N (number of nodes) threads, each of which runs the logic for Nth node. each of the node can be of  type Node(honest node), FailStop (fail stop adversary) and Byzantine(Byzantine adversary). 

each node creates two additional threads for sending and receiving messages. messages are transmitted by passing the reference of the message into the receive queue of the receiver queue. 

there are 3 types of messages. priority(priority of the subuser), Block(block proposal), vote (generated during BA*) messages. 

on receiving the priority message node updates the highest priority received so far.
on receiving the Block message node updates the highest priority block received so far and save it.


Context of the round is captured by the object of the class RoundInfo. which is updated atomically by use of semaphore at the end of the round.
