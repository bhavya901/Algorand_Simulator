2) tau_proposer was choosen to be 10. This was to ensure that the propability of having 0 proposer is not significant. if tau_propoper is equal to 10 then prob. of such event happening is (e^-10)*64 which is 0.003. And we also observed in our logs that no such round existed where there were 0 proposers. The value was choosen to ensure that the probability of getting final consensus is high.

There is no minimum bound for minimum value of tau_proposer to ensure no "No consensus" scenario. let tau_proposer is equal to 0 then there would be no proposer for block and hence every honest node would start the BA* algorithm with empty hash. This would result in a scenario where consensus would be reached with high majority on empty hash on the 2rd round of Binary BA* and also in the final step, resulting in addition of empty hash into the blockchain. So when there are no proposer algorand is bound to have consensus on an empty hash. Hence no scenario of "No consensus" even when tau_proposer is equal to 0. Hence there is no minimum bound for tau_proposer.
